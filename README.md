Some hacky wacky scripts for things having to do with the Allen&amp;Heath SQ series of digital mixing consoles


## Usage

You can put the scripts to your $HOME/bin.

Usually you'd open up a console and then go to the directory in which your multitrack recording sits and do something like: find * -iname "*.wav" -exec sq-wav2flac.sh "{}" \;

## Obacht!

These scripts may damage your recorded data. Use at own risk. Backup is what you wish you hade made once anything went wrong. So do it now.

No warranties. I'm just sharing these scripts as they are.
